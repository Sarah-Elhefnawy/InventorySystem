# Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a simple console application developed using C# to practice and apply the basic C# concepts learned previously. This project is part of a series of projects aimed at improving C# skills without delving into complex Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

The Inventory Management System includes the following key features:

1. **Add Product**:
   - Allows the user (warehouse manager) to add a new product to the inventory.
   - The user can enter details like the product ID, name, quantity, and price.

2. **Update Product**:
   - Enables the user to update an existing product's information, such as the price, name, or quantity.

3. **View Products**:
   - Displays a list of all the products currently available in the inventory.
   - Shows the details of each product, including the ID, name, quantity, and price.

4. **Exit System**:
   - Provides an option for the user to exit the Inventory Management System.
  
## Concepts Covered

This project aims to demonstrate the application of the following C# concepts:

- Input/Output (Console.ReadLine(), Console.WriteLine())
- Data types (string, int, float)
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case)
- Loops (for, while)
- Arrays and collections
- Basic error handling
